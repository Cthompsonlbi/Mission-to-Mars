# Mission-to-Mars
Module 10
## Deliverable 1
 For Module 10 challenge Deliverable 1, we had to web scrape Full-Resolution Mars hemisphere images and titles that will be added to a web app that we created while working through module 10.  The snippet below is a function created in scraping.py that will interate through 'Sample' immages using a for loop and find_by_css to pull the image link and title and store it to a dictionary and then finally to a list be be used later by the index.html file.
